# Animal Appreciation

This is my recurring assignment for the Web Server Technologies course. I created a website showing appreciation for animals. I used skills from Web Development 1 and Web Development 2 to initially create this website and then used what I learned during the semester every week to build upon the website. This includes an admin side of the site with a log in and capabilities to search through, add, modify (price), or delete store items from the website database.

#### header.php
Notes css stylesheets, title, and jQuery script and displays the header and navigation links. Used for most pages on the website.

#### footer.php
Displays the footer of the website, including the admin link. Used for most pages on the website.

#### index.php
The homepage of the website. Uses a carousel made with Javascript to scroll through featured animals.

#### news.php
Shows animal related news and photo albums.

#### tips.php
Shows tips written by animal care experts.

#### contact.php
Form where the admin can be contacted by the user on a variety of matters.

#### store.php
Shows animal-related merchandise and prices. Items will be added and deleted by the admin.

#### admin.php
Login page for the admin in order to get into the database.

#### admin-only.php

#### addmerch.php, insert.php

#### deletemerch.php, delete.php

#### updateprice.php, update.php

***This web app needs a web server (such as Apache or Nginx) and a MySQL database with the same table and attribute names in order for it to work.***
