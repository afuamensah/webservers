                <p class="author">From the Charlotte Observer, written by Mark Price</p>
                <p>A North Carolina animal sanctuary says someone broke into the facility and swiped 
                    examples of “the most wonderful and rare of native species on the property”: three 
                    North American River Otters. The trio were taken Thursday night from the North Carolina 
                    Animal Ed.Ventures Sanctuary in Coats, said the sanctuary in a press release. The site 
                    is about 40 miles south of Raleigh. The stolen critters, weighing between 18 to 25 pounds, 
                    are named Sigmund, Nessy, and Ned. </p>

                    <p>“River otters are some of the rarest native wildlife in America, as their numbers have 
                        drastically reduced over recent years due to deforestation along waterways where they 
                        normally thrive,” park spokeswoman Shelley Metzger told the Charlotte Observer.

                        “A case in which someone would selectively steal river otters among all the possible 
                        animals and leaving all others undisturbed is especially curious.” Sanctuary Director 
                        Cory Freeman said in a release that workers found the entrance gate and animal enclosure 
                        gate open, indicating it was a theft rather than an escape. Freeman told WTVD the sanctuary 
                        isn’t sure what motives the thieves had in taking the otters.

                        “We don’t know if this is motivated by money, we don’t know if this was motivated by an extremist 
                        group that feels like all animals should be free,” she told the station. “Are they being properly 
                        cared for? Does this person even know what they eat and what they need? They’re not a creature that 
                        you can just put in a cage.
                        <br>
                        “It’s devastating,” Freeman added, according to WTVD.

                        The Harnett County Sheriff’s Office is investigating and among the clues is “an oddly high pitched 
                        burst of noise in the middle of the night,” that may indicate when the animals were taken, said the 
                        sanctuary press release. This marks the third time “in recent history” that animals have been taken 
                        from the sanctuary, which is surrounded by a perimeter fence to prevent escapes, officials said. Animal 
                        Ed.Ventures Sanctuary opened 18 years ago as an “exotic wildlife” site and is “home to 200 animals once 
                        kept as pets,” said a release. The sanctuary’s goal is to teach wildlife conservation, while offering 
                        homes to at-risk exotic animals that faced jeopardy or were being illegally held, officials told the Observer.

                        “Our main concern is the welfare and safety of our animals -- otters have very specialized needs and we are worried sick,” Freeman said in a release.</p>
